## Project 4: Temporal Association Analysis Using Functional Models for Sparse Longitudinal Microbiome Data 

In this project, we are introducing functional linear modeling tool to analysis the sparse longitudinal microbiome data. The goal of our analysis is to reveal the temporal association effects between functional predictors and functional/scalar outcomes. We used the functional PCA-based method to recover the trajectory of the microbiome data and performed the penalized functional model to estimate the temporal effects of microbiome on outcome of interest. In a simulation study, we evaluated the performance of the functional models for on different proportions of the missing data (caused by irregular time) on different length of the time window. Furthermore, we analyzed a real longitudinal data set to understand the effect of gut microbiome on the faecal calprotectin.
