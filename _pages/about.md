My name is Caizhi David Huang. Currently I am a Senior Scientist in Biostatistics at Merck & Co. In my work, I provide statistical solutions and ensure adherence to scientific principles and statistical methods in study design and analysis. I also collaborate with diverse professionals, serve as a statistical representative in cross-functional teams, identify and resolve technical problems, add value to development programs, analyze and interpret data, communicate results effectively, respond to queries, and contribute to research on innovative statistical methods.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics (focus on statistical genetics) co-advised by [Dr. Jung-Ying Tzeng](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jytzeng/) and [Dr. Benjamin Callahan](https://callahanlab.cvm.ncsu.edu/team/) at NC State University. My dissertation focuses on microbiome data analysis (See the [Projects](http://hczdavid.github.io/projects) for details), including developing new association test methods for microbiome data (cross sectional and longitudinal), performing meta-analysis of vaginal microbiome using machine learning and developing hypothesis testing strategy to detect contaminants in microbiome data. During my Ph.D. study, I also obtained Master of Statistics (concentrate on Biostatistics) with statistics PhD-level project and course training. My undergradate degree is in Bioengineering (focus on microbiology).

In microbiome research, the communication among biologist, bioinformatician and statistician often challenged by different research focuses and interests. My unique background and training (combination of biology, bioinformatics and statistics) provides me the capability to perform comprehensive statistical research and analysis with the perspective of biologist and bioinformatician.

With solid scientific writing and presentation training ([Publications and Presentations](http://hczdavid.github.io/publications)), productive industry summer internship experiences ([CV](http://hczdavid.github.io/files/DavidHuangResume.pdf)), I am equipped with multiple transferable skills:

  * Technical skills:
    * statistical modeling and interpretation
    * machine learning and deep learning
    * tool development including R package and Shiny app
    * strong programming skills using R, Python and SAS
    * data visualization

  * Soft skills:
    * strong writing/communication using technical and non-technical language.
    * productive teamwork
    * proactive leadership
    * efficient time and task management
